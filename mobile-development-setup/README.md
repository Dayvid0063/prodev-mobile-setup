# Mobile Development Setup

This documentation outlines the steps taken to set up the mobile development environment using Expo Go.

## Tools Installed

- **Node.js LTS**
- **VS Code**
- **Expo Go**

## Steps Followed

1. Installed Node.js LTS from the official website.
2. Installed VS Code and added the React Native Tools extension.
3. Installed Expo Go on my physical device from the Apple App Store.
4. Created an account on Expo Go.

## Challenges Faced

- **Challenge 1**: Initially, I had trouble installing Node.js due to permission issues. I resolved this by running the installer as an administrator.
- **Challenge 2**: The Expo Go app was not loading my projects initially. I fixed this by ensuring that my device and development machine were on the same Wi-Fi network.

## Conclusion

The setup process was straightforward, and I am now ready to start developing mobile applications using Expo Go and React Native.
